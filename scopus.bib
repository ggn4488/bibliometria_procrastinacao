	abstract = {Statistics is one of the most challenging courses for university students. The personal learning environment (PLE) pedagogical design was introduced to assist students' Statistics learning. With the PLE pedagogy, this study examined learners' demographic backgrounds, motivational measures (i.e., help-seeking and academic procrastination due to the use of Information and Communication Technologies, ICT), and ill-structured data (i.e., Facebook posts and comments) to understand what student demographic information, how they feel, and what they do can impact their statistics learning performance. Seventy-eight people joined Facebook groups to form statistics learning communities. Using weakly supervised machine learning (ML), we categorized students' Facebook messages into statistics-relevant and statistics-irrelevant. Results of the learning analytics on multimodal sources of student data showed that help-seeking positively predicted statistics achievement. In contrast, academic procrastination with ICT negatively predicted statistics achievement, controlling for students' demographics information, including age, gender, prior knowledge, and Internet/social media use. Moreover, the ensemble ML classified messages constructed by taking the sum of relevance coding (0 or 1) across three selected ML algorithms was highly aligned with the human coded message in terms of the degree of relevance to statistics. The ensemble ML classified messages were conceptualized as students’ cognitive engagement in statistics learning due to their high consistency with the human-labeled relevance coding and were positively associated with statistics achievement with a large effect size. The study contributed to developing an integrated learner-centered learning analytics framework with the PLE pedagogical design encompassing learner backgrounds and unstructured learner artifacts. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

Therefore, it is necessary to explore the influencing factors of academic procrastination and its internal mechanisms. This study aims to explore the relationship between perceived parental autonomy support and academic procrastination, as well as the role of autonomous motivation and time management disposition. Participants and Methods: Cross-sectional data from 662 middle school students were collected using the Parental Autonomy Support Scale, Academic Procrastination Inventory for Middle School Students, Academic Self-Regulation Questionnaire and Adolescence Time Management Disposition Scale. SPSS and its PROCESS macro were used for data analysis. Results: After gender and age were controlled, the results showed that perceived parental autonomy support could not only directly predict middle school students’ academic procrastination but also predict three paths of procrastination: (1) the mediating role of autonomous motivation, (2) the mediating role of time management disposition, and (3) the chain mediating role of autonomous motivation and time management disposition. Conclusion: Autonomous motivation and time management disposition played a chain mediating role in the relationship between perceived parental autonomy support and academic procrastination in middle school students. © 2022 Zhao et al.},

There was a negative direct effect of procrastination on AP and positive direct effects of major satisfaction and absorption on AP. Trait EI showed a negative direct effect on procrastination and a positive direct effect on major satisfaction, which, in turn, significantly predicted AP. Also, conscientiousness indirectly predicted AP, via procrastination, major satisfaction, and absorption. Findings point at individual differences contributing to AP and can be helpful to students, educators, and counselors in higher education. © 2019 Sanchez-Ruiz and El Khoury.},

Methods: Baseline data from students recruited for an intervention study were gathered using psychometrically sound instruments assessing symptom distress, procrastination, study habits, academic self-efficacy, and campus engagement. Results were compared to reference samples of college students without identified mental health issues and then correlational analyses were conducted to examine their relationship with degree of mental health symptom distress. Results: Students with serious mental illnesses scored lower on most measures associated with academic performance. Greater symptom distress was associated with poorer academic habits and self-efficacy, but not campus engagement. Conclusions: This study supports hypothesized mechanisms by which mental health symptoms impact academic performance and suggests interventions aimed at addressing these factors while treatment is in process. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

Results: The results revealed that 37.4% of the sample were addicted to smartphone use, while 7.7% had a high level of procrastination, and 62.8% had an average level of procrastination. The results did not show statistically significant differences in smartphone addiction and quality of life according to gender and educational stage, while there were statistically significant differences in academic procrastination according to gender in favor of males, and according to stage of education in favor of undergraduate students. The results also revealed a statistically significant positive relationship between academic procrastination and smartphone addiction, and a statistically significant negative relationship between smartphone addiction and quality of life. A negative relationship between quality of life and academic procrastination was found. The results also revealed that addiction to smartphones could be predicted through academic procrastination and quality of life. © 2022 by the authors.},

Considerable literature has grown up around the influence of these psychological properties on L2 writing specifically. However, the impact of academic procrastination, which is an important psychological property, has been understudied and it remains unclear how affective factors in L2 might play a role in the above potential influence on L2 writing. Therefore, the current study explored the impact of academic procrastination on L2 writing and examined the mediating role of L2 writing anxiety, by adopting text readability as an innovative approach to assessing L2 writing performance. Participants were 55 Chinese speakers of L2 English. By utilizing the collected questionnaire data and the readability indicators of the L2 writing task, the current research conducted correlation analysis, regression analysis, and structural equation modeling analysis. The results revealed that academic procrastination had a significant negative impact on the readability indicator of Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level in L2 writing. L2 writing anxiety played a complete mediating role in the impact. Academic procrastination can significantly affect Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level of L2 writing indirectly through L2 writing anxiety. Pedagogical implications and future studies were discussed. Copyright © 2022 Zhang and Zhang.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Academic procrastination is a complex phenomenon and a common behavior among nursing students. Due to procrastinating behaviors, students cannot show their real performances in learning processes. In order to stop this behavior, it is crucial to know the most common causes of procrastination in the first place. The aim of this study was to identify a variety of different possible factors influencing academic procrastination among nursing students. MATERIALS AND METHOD: A qualitative study method with the content analysis approach was conducted from October 2019 to March 2020. Participants were 67 nursing students and 8 nursing educators from 3 nursing schools in Iran. Face-to-face semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions were used for data gathering. An inductive approach to content analysis was used for data analysis. RESULTS: Five categories and 24 subcategories emerged from the data analysis: 'student-related factors,' 'educator-related factor,' 'assignment characteristic-related factors,' 'institution-related factors,' and 'nursing work-related factors.' CONCLUSIONS: The present study showed that nursing students' academic procrastination can have a wide range of causes and a comprehensive effort is needed to address the problems. The result of our study will be useful to nursing students, educators, and nursing administrators in relation to what constitutes nursing students' academic procrastination, as well as how nursing education can play an effective role in decreasing tendency to procrastination. © 2021 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

Statistics anxiety (SA) has a detrimental impact on academic experiences in university populations, although the mediating factors remain underexplored. We conducted the first systematic review and meta-analysis focused on SA in university students in the context of statistical performance, individual differences in statistical learning, self-perceptions regarding the statistics course and instructor, and sociodemographic factors. Searches were carried out in the PsycINFO, PubMed, Scielo, and Web of Science databases according to our preregistration. Forty studies were selected for systematic review. Seventeen were included in a series of six meta-analyses concerning academic achievement, attitudes, self-perception, procrastination, and gender. The findings reveal learning strategies, procrastination, self-efficacy, and self-awareness as predictors of SA. However, the impact of sociodemographic data in these moderators is still uncharted. We conclude with a critical appraisal of the selected studies and present future directions for research in SA. © 2022 New York Academy of Sciences.},

	abstract = {It has been shown that perfectionism is a precursor to passive procrastination, which is a form of self-regulation failure, but little is known about the role of perfectionism in active procrastination. Thus, we sought to determine the relationship of high standards and discrepancy with active procrastination, which is a functional form of procrastination linked to better academic performance and psychological well-being. A convenience sample of 175 undergraduate students completed the Almost Perfect Scale-Revised and the Active Procrastination Scale. The results show therewas a negative correlation between discrepancy and active procrastination. Students who perceived a larger discrepancy between their own performance goals and their actual performance were less likely to procrastinate actively. This suggests that the influence of perfectionism on procrastination may extend to active procrastination. Therefore, the implementation of interventions aimed at reducing individuals' perfectionistic tendencies is of great importance.  © 2022 Scientific Journal Publishers Limited. All Rights Reserved.},

	abstract = {Social networking sites (SNSs) confer countless benefits to mankind through increased communication and connection between and among millions of people on the globe. Do the detrimental effects of SNSs outweigh its benefits? We have tried to answer this question through reviewing the relevant literature on the repercussions of use of SNSs on sleep quality, psychosocial behavior, academic performance and circadian rhythm in humans. Literature on the subject underscores the adverse effects of SNSs usage on sleep resulting in poor sleep quality, delayed sleep onset, shortening of sleep length, excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), insomnia, apnea and nightmare. The students addicted to social media suffer from psychiatric distress, anxiety, depression, low self-esteem, suicidal ideation, procrastination and poor academic attainment. There is, however, a paucity of literature on the effects of overuse of SNSs on the functioning of circadian clocks in humans. It emerged that the adolescents and young adults are the most vulnerable to the ill effects of excessive use of the SNSs. We recommend that more researches on the effects of SNSs on human health should be carried out and effective awareness campaigns should be launched to educate the people about the darker side of the excessive use of SNSs. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Procrastination remains an omnipresent phenomenon impeding especially students’ academic performance and well-being. Preliminary findings suggest that procrastination emerges due to dysfunctional emotion regulation efforts to regulate aversive emotions. This study’s objective was to clarify whether the enhancement of general adaptive emotion regulation skills reduces subsequent procrastination. For the purpose of this study, data from a two-armed randomized controlled trial (RCT) with (N = 148) university students, comprising an active intervention (IG) and a passive wait-list control (WLC) group, was collected. Participants of the intervention group were provided with an online emotion regulation training over a period of 9 weeks. The results showed that the enhancement of general emotion regulation skills significantly reduced subsequent procrastination behavior within the IG as compared to the untreated WLC. Moreover, subsequent mediation analyses revealed that the reduction of procrastination was significantly mediated by the increase in general ER skills. The present results suggest that trainings which enhance general ER skills are an appropriate measure to reduce procrastination behavior among university students. The practical value of ER training interventions, particularly for student populations, is discussed. Copyright © 2022 Schuenemann, Scherenberg, von Salisch and Eckert.},

The extent of this phenomenon among students and the negative impact on their academic achievement requires more attention and research on this issue. The present study was conducted with the aim of investigating on the role of fear of failure and subscale of self-regulation (memory strategy goal-setting, self-evaluation, helping assistance, responsibility, organization) in relation with academic procrastination. Therefore, 198 students from different schools of University of Isfahan in Iran were selected by random cluster multistage sampling. Student’s Procrastination Assessment Scale, Performance Failure Appraisal Inventory, and Sevari’s Self-regulation Questionnaire were used. Data were analyzed by t-test, Pearson correlations and linear regression in SPSS-22. Results of t-test showed significant differences between male and female students in terms of academic procrastination, organizing, and fear of failure. Male students compared to females scored higher in academic procrastination. Females students compared to males scored higher in fear of failure and organizing. Findings of Pearson correlations showed a positive association between fear of failure and academic procrastination, and a negative association between subscales of self-regulation and academic procrastination. Also, linear regression analyses showed that fear of failure and responsibility predict academic procrastination. As a conclusion, in order to reduce procrastination, some interventions can be delivered by handling in students’ fear of failure and self-regulation. © 2020 JESTP.},

	abstract = {Academic procrastination – habitually delaying work with academic tasks to the extent that the delays become detrimental to performance, wellbeing, and health – represents a substantial personal, systemic, and societal problem. Still, efforts to prevent and reduce it are surprisingly scarce and often offered as treatment regimens rather than preventive efforts. Based on the principles of functional analysis and a broad examination of factors that are important for academic procrastinatory behaviors, this paper aims to describe a strategy for analyzing individual controlling conditions for procrastination and give parallel advice on how to change those controlling conditions. Both are ideographic, allowing for individual and dynamic analyses of factors responsible for instigating and maintaining procrastination, as well as tailor-made remedies that address controlling conditions in preventive and curative efforts to reduce procrastination. Although functional analysis integrates well with important research findings in the procrastination field, this approach suggests new criteria for identifying procrastinatory behaviors and an alternative model for analyzing their control conditions. We conclude that a functional approach may supplement procrastination research and efforts to prevent and alleviate this detrimental habit. Copyright © 2022 Svartdal and Løkke.},

	abstract = {Background and purpose: Procrastination is common among collegiate students and has been associated with negative academic performance. Avoidance of procrastination may improve learning efficiency and outcomes, especially in course-intensive doctor of pharmacy (PharmD) programs. This study investigated the perceptions of pharmacy students on student-organized procrastination prevention events (PPEs) and determined whether participation in these events affected assessment grades. Educational activity and setting: Quarterly, voluntary PPEs for professional year one (PY1), professional year 2 (PY2), and professional year three (PY3) PharmD students were hosted by the Rho Chi Society. These events occurred one to two weeks prior to historically challenging assessments. Faculty of related courses were invited to lead review sessions. Rho Chi members designed and delivered interactive learning activities and were available for peer-led group study. Attendance was recorded and anonymous voluntary exit surveys were conducted. Assessment scores on topics of focus were compared between the group that attended the event vs. the group that did not attend. Findings: Based on the 153 pooled anonymous survey results, the majority of participants were < 25 years of age, female, and did not have children. Perception data from the surveys were universally positive. Most assessment score comparisons of PPE attendees vs. non-attendees were not statistically significant. Immunology showed improved scores in event attendees. Although attending PPEs did not significantly improve assessment scores in most courses, students recognized the benefits of the events. Future research could study the overall impact of these events and best practices for hosting them. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

Through a randomized control trial of students in a for-credit online course at a public 4-year university, we test the efficacy of a scheduling intervention aimed at improving students’ time management. Results indicate the intervention had positive effects on initial achievement scores; students who were given the opportunity to schedule their lecture watching in advance scored about a third of a standard deviation better on the first quiz than students who were not given that opportunity. These effects are concentrated in students with the lowest self-reported time management skills. However, these effects diminish over time such that we see a marginally significant negative effect of treatment on the last week’s quiz grade and no difference in overall course scores. We examine the effect of the intervention on plausible mechanisms to explain the observed achievement effects. We find no evidence that the intervention affected cramming, procrastination, or the time at which students did work. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.},

In the university context, they can lead to academic procrastination behaviour and undermine students’ academic performance. The aims of this study are a) to identify profiles of students with similar values in excessive use, lack of control and obsession with social networks, and b) analyse whether there are significant differences in procrastination behaviours and academic performance of the identified profiles. A total of 1784 students from 24 Spanish universities took part in the study. The Social Network Addiction Questionnaire and the Spanish version of the Procrastination Assessment Scale-Student test were used. Profiles were identified through Latent Profile Analysis and differences between groups were analysed through the three-step Bolck-Croon-Hagenaars method. The results showed three profiles regarding the excessive use of social networks: low addiction, moderate addiction and high addiction. Significant differences were found between the three latent profiles in academic procrastination, showing that the higher the addiction to social networks, the higher the procrastination behaviour. However, there were no significant differences between the groups with respect to academic performance. In conclusion, although the addiction to social networks is related to procrastination behaviour, it is considered that they could be a useful resource in the initial training process of undergraduates. © 2022 The Authors},

Guided by expectancy-value theory, we examined whether relations between perceived costs and physics outcomes (i.e., engagement and achievement) varied as a function of self-efficacy or task values among undergraduate physics students (N = 1,124). We also examined whether the interactive relations were further moderated by course level in the curricular sequence. Overall, findings from moderated moderation analyses indicated that perceived costs were negatively related to different components of engagement (i.e., effort, persistence, procrastination, and choice) and achievement (i.e., physics course grades). However, the magnitude of relations often depended on levels of self-efficacy or task value. Some of the interactive relations between these variables also differed between introductory- and upper-level physics courses. Taken together, results indicated that higher self-efficacy or task values do not compensate for the negative effects of perceiving high cost on engagement. Moreover, cost perceptions were in some cases more negatively related to engagement when students reported higher self-efficacy or task values. Finally, mitigating cost perceptions may be particularly important in introductory undergraduate physics courses. Implications and directions for future research are discussed. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Based on the logic that self-oriented perfectionism (SOP) is one of the most well-established predictors of academic procrastination (AP), we predicted that fear of failure (FF) would mediate the association between SOP and AP. The purpose of this study is to investigate the mediating effect of FF on the influence of SOP on AP in medical students. Methods: A total of 156 undergraduate medical students completed a battery of questionnaires. This study is an analysis of cross-sectional data obtained through an offline survey. The self-report questionnaires assessed demographics and psychological scales, including the Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale, Performance Failure Appraisal Inventory, and Aitken Procrastination Inventory. The data were analyzed by descriptive statistics, correlations analysis, and multiple regression analyses using IBM SPSS ver. 22.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, USA). Results: SOP had a direct negative influence on AP (β=-0.420, p<0.001). Also, SOP had a significant indirect effect on AP through FF (β=0.0393; 95% confidence interval, 0.040-0.0936). These results indicated that the FF partially mediates the relationship between SOP and AP. Conclusion: Although SOP among medical students might play an adaptive role to lessen AP, in cases FF gets higher, SOP could have opposing effects via the mediating effect of FF, leading to an actual increase in AP. Attempts to deal with the FF among medical students should be made for better academic achievements. © 2022, The Korean Society of Medical Education},

Community college students (N = 339) were randomly assigned to stress reappraisal or active control conditions immediately before taking their second in-class exam. Whereas stress is typically perceived as having negative effects, stress reappraisal informs individuals about the functional benefits of stress and is hypothesized to reduce threat appraisals, and subsequently, improve downstream outcomes. Multilevel models indicated that compared with controls, reappraising stress led to less math evaluation anxiety, lower threat appraisals, more adaptive neuroendocrine responses (lower cortisol and higher testosterone levels on testing days relative to baseline), and higher scores on Exam 2 and on a subsequent Exam 3. Reappraisal students also persisted in their courses at a higher rate than controls. Targeted mediation models suggested stress appraisals partially mediated effects of reappraisal. Notably, procrastination and performance approach goals (measured between exams) partially mediated lagged effects of reappraisal on subsequent performance. Implications for the stress, emotion regulation, and mindsets literatures are discussed. Moreover, alleviating negative effects of acute stress in community college students, a substantial but understudied population, has potentially important applied implications. © 2021 American Psychological Association},

	abstract = {Most college students have grown up using technology and consequently, they are proficient with its many uses and applications. The use of this technology provides many benefits to college students’ learning, both in and out of the classroom. However, despite the numerous benefits of technology, these digital activities can also lead to much digital distraction. Digital distractions may include Internet surfing, watching movies, checking texts, reading, and sending emails, and perusing social media. These digital distractions often result in limited attention and engagement during class, as well as less learning and academic achievement overall. Digital distraction can result from such factors as anxiety and depression, motivational variables, the need to keep up and the fear of missing out, emotional numbing and procrastination as well as an overreliance on multitasking. It is suggested here that the use of self-regulated learning (SRL) strategies may be effective in assisting college students in avoiding digital distractions, both in and out of the classroom. SRL strategies include forethought, planning, activation; monitoring, control and reflection on the learner’s cognition, motivation/affect, and behavior. Through the use of these SRL strategies, college students may be taught to decrease digital distractions and, thus, experience higher levels of learning and academic performance. © 2022 by authors; licensee CEDTECH by Bastas, CY.

Recent theory suggests that pursuit of excellence is related to PS but differentiated by having a more positive impact. To test this hypothesis, we used a meta-analytic analysis to examine the associations between different measures of perfectionism and academic achievement. Correlations between academic measures (performance, academic burnout and stress, test anxiety, procrastination, self-efficacy, engagement, satisfaction, adjustment, hardiness, learning strategies) and subscales of the Frost Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale, Hewitt Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale, Almost Perfect Scale-Revised, and Child and Adolescent Perfectionism Scale were investigated in students (Mage = 19.31, SD = 4.26). A systematic literature search yielded 67 studies (378 effect sizes). Subscales relating to standards (High Standards, Personal Standards, Self-Oriented Perfectionism) were positively related to academic performance and helpful academic outcomes. Only High Standards, which has a focus on striving for excellence, had negative associations with unhelpful academic outcomes. Two of the four subscales that measured PC (Discrepancy, Doubts about Actions) were negatively related to academic performance, and Discrepancy shared a negative association with helpful academic outcomes. All PC subscales were positively associated with unhelpful academic outcomes. As such, PC are maladaptive for successful learning and a distinction between PS and healthy pursuit of excellence is worth further exploration. © 2019 American Psychological Association.},

Previous studies showed that procrastination is associated with executive dysfunctions that seem to be particularly strong in punishing contexts. In the present event-related potential (ERP) study a monetary version of the parametric Go/No-Go task was performed by high and low academic procrastinators to verify the influence of motivational context (reward vs. punishment expectation) and task difficulty (easy vs. hard) on procrastination-related executive dysfunctions. The results revealed increased post-error slowing along with reduced P300 and error-related negativity (ERN) amplitudes in high (vs. low) procrastination participants—effects that indicate impaired attention and error-related processing in this group. This pattern of results did not differ as a function of task difficulty and motivation condition. However, when the task got more difficult executive attention deficits became even more apparent at the behavioral level in high procrastinators, as indexed by increased reaction time variability. The findings substantiate prior preliminary evidence that procrastinators show difficulties in certain aspects of executive functioning (in attention and error processing) during execution of task-relevant behavior, which may be more apparent in highly demanding situations. © 2020, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Procrastination refers to the voluntary avoidance or postponement of action that needs to be taken, that results in negative consequences such as low academic performance, anxiety, and low self-esteem. Previous work has demonstrated the role of social networking site (SNS) design in users’ procrastination and revealed several types of procrastination on SNS. In this work, we propose a method to combat procrastination on SNS (D-Crastinate). We present the theories and approaches that informed the design of D-Crastinate method and its stages. The method is meant to help users to identify the type of procrastination they experience and the SNS features that contribute to that procrastination. Then, based on the results of this phase, a set of customised countermeasures are suggested for each user with guidelines on how to apply them. To evaluate our D-Crastinate method, we utilised a mixed-method approach that included a focus group, diary study and survey. We evaluate the method in terms of its clarity, coverage, efficiency, acceptance and whether it helps to increase users’ consciousness and management of their own procrastination. The evaluation study involved participants who self-declared that they frequently procrastinate on SNS. The results showed a positive impact of D-Crastinate in increasing participants’ awareness and control over their procrastination and, hence, enhancing their digital wellbeing. © 2020 by the authors.

	abstract = {COVID-19 affected all sectors, including academia, which resulted in an increase in online learning. While education continued through online platforms, various students-related problems arose, including improper time management, procrastination, and fluctuating academic performance. It is in this context that this quantitative study was carried out to determine how time management and procrastination affected students’ performance in science and mathematics during the pandemic. We surveyed 650 Filipino high school students using the Procrastination Assessment Scale-Students and Wayne State University’s Time Management questionnaire with a 0.93 reliability coefficient. The findings revealed that in science and mathematics, female students outperformed males. Eleven 12-year-olds had the highest mean grades in science and mathematics, while 15 16-year-olds had the lowest. Younger respondents (11-14) were more likely to have better time management in than older ones. Further, older respondents (15-18) procrastinate more than younger ones. Time management correlates positively with success in science and mathematics. Achievement in science and mathematics is the highest among students with good time management. Procrastination negatively affects achievement. High school students who procrastinated less fare better in mathematics. With this, the study opens possibilities for teaching older learners in time management to boost their performance. Students across ages should be urged to avoid procrastinating as it negatively affects academic performance. As reinforcement, schools may educate learners on time management and procrastination avoidance through orientations and other platforms. © 2022 Society for Research and Knowledge Management.

The baseline Metacognition intervention was an hourlong workshop focused on effective learning strategies and self-awareness in the learning process; the extended Metacognition plus Time Management (Metacognition+TM) intervention included the aforementioned workshop plus a second hourlong workshop on time management and procrastination. Based on three exams and self-report surveys administered before the intervention and at the end of the semester, students who participated in the Metacognition+TM intervention experienced greater increases in their exam scores and degree commitment than those in the baseline intervention. Additionally, group status moderated the effect of the intervention, as the Metacognition+TM intervention was especially effective in increasing use of time management tools by students from minoritized groups. © 2021 The American Society for Cell Biology.},

	abstract = {Background: procrastination is highly prevalent amongst students and impairs academic performance. The metacognitive model of procrastination explains a significant proportion of unintentional procrastination variance. However, the model has yet to be tested using academic performance as the dependent variable. We tested whether the metacognitive model of procrastination explained self-reported academic performance (AP). Methods: a convenience sample of 204 current undergraduate and postgraduate students completed a battery of online questionnaires that measured intentional and unintentional procrastination, metacognitions about procrastination, AP, and depression. We conducted a series of correlation analyses and a path analysis (based on the metacognitive model of procrastination) that specified AP as the dependent variable. Results: the correlation analyses indicated that there are significant, negative associations between AP and depression, AP and negative metacognitions about procrastination, and AP and unintentional procrastination. The tested model was a good fit of the data and explained 13% of the variance in AP. Limitations: this study is cross-sectional. Conclusions: our findings provide further support for the metacognitive model of procrastination, indicating that novel interventions that target metacognitions may help to tackle procrastination and optimize AP. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Procrastination behavior is quite ubiquitous, and should warrant cautions to us owing to its significant influences in poor mental health, low subjective well-beings and bad academic performance. However, how to identify this behavioral problem have not yet to be fully elucidated. 1132 participants were recruited as distribution of benchmark. 81 high trait procrastinators (HP) and matched low trait procrastinators (LP) were screened. To address this issue, we have built upon the hybrid brain model by using hierarchical machine learning techniques to classify HP and LP with multi-modalities neuroimaging data (i.e., grey matter volume, fractional anisotropy, static/dynamic amplitude of low frequency fluctuation and static/dynamic degree centrality). Further, we capitalized on the multiple Canonical Correlation Analysis (mCCA) and joint Independent Component Analysis algorithm (mCCA + jICA) to clarify its fusion neural components as well. The hybrid brain model showed high accuracy to discriminate HP and LP (accuracy rate = 87.04%, sensitivity rate = 86.42%, specificity rate = 85.19%). Moreover, results of mCCA + jICA model revealed several joint-discriminative neural independent components (ICs) of this classification, showing wider co-variants of frontoparietal cortex and hippocampus networks. In addition, this study demonstrated three modal-specific discriminative ICs for classification, highlighting the temporal variants of brain local and global natures in ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and PHC in HP. To sum-up, this research developed a hybrid brain model to identify trait procrastination with high accuracy, and further revealed the neural hallmarks of this trait by integrating neuroimaging fusion data. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

	abstract = {Study breaks and exam revision weeks are increasingly embedded in learning design under the assumption that students would make use of this time to catch up with their study or prepare for upcoming assessment tasks. However, there remains a paucity of empirical evidence to evaluate to what extent the implementation of study breaks, preparation and exam revision weeks impact students’ engagement and academic performance. By applying learning analytics in a computer-based assessment (CBA) setting, this study investigates how study break weeks and assessment preparation weeks impacted the odds of passing a module using a mixed-effect logistic regression on 123,916 undergraduate students in 205 modules over several semesters from 2015–2017 at the Open University. Furthermore, we investigated the intertemporal characteristics of student engagement during preparation weeks for a final assessment in an Introductory Business course over three semesters. A mixed-effect logistic regression was used to model behavioural engagement of 3385 students on the VLE (i.e. click counts) over three semesters during the assessment preparation weeks. Our findings indicated a positive association between study breaks and the odds of passing a course, while there was no statistically significant effect in relation to the number of assessment preparation and revision weeks. Analysis of behavioural engagement on the VLE suggested that there was a higher proportion of passed students remained active during preparation and exam revision weeks compared to failed students. Compared to the pass group, the fail group also exhibited a stronger pattern of procrastination. This study offers new insights that could help institution management and course designer to evaluate the efficacy of using study breaks and exam preparation weeks to improve student retention. © 2018, The Author(s).},

Findings indicated that studying procrastination was negatively associated with final exam grade as well as with the three online course participation measures. Final exam grade was positively associated with two of the online course participation measures, and they positively correlated with each other. In addition, results indicated that studying procrastination, in combination with online course participation measures, explained about 50% of variance in final exam’s grade. Frequency of activities in course Web site had the strongest positive effect on final exam’s grade.

Lower procrastination and higher performance were found in group work with an indispensable contribution as compared to individual work.

The current study examines students’ perceptions of politics in higher education institutions. It focuses on the causes and outcomes of those perceptions. We predict that students who have positive perceptions of the academic climate and faculty guidance will perceive their academic environment as less political. In addition, we argue that that procrastination is one possible negative outcome of POP in an academic environment. The study is based on quantitative data collected from 290 college students. The findings suggest that interacting with students and providing them with academic advice and feedback on their performance reduces the extent to which students perceive their academic environment as being political. The results support that the theory that organizational politics are a universal phenomenon occurring in every organization and in all types of populations, including students in academic institutions or perhaps even children in schools. Additionally, the study shows that POP have a clearly negative influence on students’ attitudes and behavior in the realm of academic procrastination. © 2020, Universitatea din Oradea.

Using real-time assessment of both procrastination and flow, the authors investigated how these factors impact academic performance by using the Experience Sampling Method. They assessed flow by measuring student self-reported skill versus challenge, and procrastination by measuring the days to completion of an assignment. Procrastination and flow were measured for six days before a writing assignment due date while students (n = 14) were enrolled in a research methods course. Regardless of status of flow, both the nonflow and flow groups showed high levels of procrastination. Students who experienced flow as they worked on their paper, in real time, earned significantly higher grades (M = 3.05 ± 0.30: an average grade of B) as compared with the nonflow group (M = 1.16 ± 0.33: an average grade of D; p =.007). Additionally, students experiencing flow were more accurate in predicting their grade (difference scores, flow M = 0.12 ± 0.33 vs. nonflow M = 1.39 ± 0.29; p =.015). Students in the nonflow group were nearly a grade and a half off in their prediction of their grade on the paper. To the authors' knowledge, the study is the first to provide experimental evidence showing differences in academic performance between students experiencing flow and nonflow students. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

A total number of 273 females and 179 males (aged between 18 and 28) were included in the study. Tuckman procrastination scale, Academic Life Satisfaction Scale, Concern over Mistake Scale, Poor Time Management Scale, Self-Doubt Scale, Irrational Beliefs about Studying Scale, Positive and Negative Affect Schedule and Life Satisfaction Scale were used to gather data. Results indicated that 50% of participants were more likely to procrastinate their academic assignments or tasks. Procrastination score did not differ according to gender. The findings suggested that procrastinating students had a higher level of poor time management, self-doubt and irrational beliefs about studying, and poor academic performance and well-being than their non-procrastinating counterparts.

	abstract = {Objectives Procrastination and academic failure are factors that are on the rise among medical universities and threaten the educational system. Therefore, it is necessary to identify interventions that can reduce these factors. The present study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) on academic procrastination in Medical Sciences students of Zanjan University, Zanjan City, Iran. Methods This study was a quasi-experimental study with a pre-test & post-test design and case and control groups. The statistical population was all students with academic failure who were referred to the University Counseling Office during the academic year 1996-7, out of whom 38 were enrolled in the study considering the inclusion criteria and academic procrastination score. The study data were collected using the standard Solomon’s and Rothlobom questionnaire. Students’ academic performance was also measured by their semester grade point average. Covariance analysis and analysis of covariance were used for data analysis in SPSS V. 24. Results The mean academic procrastination was significantly different between the two groups at the post-test (P<0.05). Group F was statistically significant in academic procrastination equal to 257.553 (P<0.05), so the effectiveness of ACT on academic procrastination and its components was confirmed. Concerning academic performance, the F of the group factor was equal to 9.59 and at the level of P<0.05 which was statistically significant. Conclusion The results show the effectiveness of ACT on student’s procrastination and academic failure. © 2020, Iran University of Medical Sciences. All rights reserved.},

Further, where previous work focused on learning behaviours that enhance performance (often learning approaches), we also consider performance-undermining behaviours (self-handicapping and procrastination). These effects are explored in survey responses from an undergraduate student sample (N = 121) from UK and broader European samples. Participants were predominantly female (69%) and native English speakers (87%). Three models of the relationships between these variables were tested using Mplus. Results indicate that performance-undermining behaviours are predicted by identity incompatibility, but not identification level; deep learning approaches are predicted by identification level, but not identity incompatibility. This provides first evidence that identity incompatibility is not just a moderator of the identification-learning relationships but, in fact, a separate identity process for consideration. We also present initial evidence for a mediation model, where in the identity variables are related to procrastination and self-handicapping via learning approaches. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION. Academic procrastination is a widely extended phenomenon in education, especially among university students, which consists of deliberately putting off or completely avoiding an activity under one’s control. High levels of procrastination are related to poor academic performance and dropout intentions, as well as other psychological features such as impul-siveness, distractibility, depression and sensation-seeking, and a lack of self-control, of self-effi-cacy, of organization and of self-esteem. In Spain research on this topic is scarce and to date not a single validated and widely accepted instrument to measure academic procrastination levels at university level has been developed. The aim of this research study was 1) to develop a pro-crastionation scale in Spanish language to be used on college students, and 2) to measure the procrastination levels of education students. METHOD. Data were collected from a sample of 499 Spanish education college students with a Likert scale. RESULTS. The results showed a 24-item version of the Escala de Procrastinación Académica en español (EPAE) with excellent reliability (.908), which may be used to measure students’ procrastination tendencies. Cluster analysis re-vealed four groups depending on students’ procrastination level (low, low-medium, medium, above medium). Over 76% of the sample had low and low-medium procrastination levels, while more than 23% reported medium levels, while not a single student showed higher procrastination levels. DISCUSSION. These results point at a need for further researching this topic in Spain by making use of the validated and reliable scale presented here, which may help to monitor student learning. By designing interventions targeted at high procrastinators, the risk of dropout and low academic performance may be reduced. © Sociedad Española de Pedagogía.},

Objective: To analyze the evidence of validity and reliability of an academic procrastination scale in Cuban dental students. Methods: Instrumental, cross-sectional and multicenter study, which included students from seven Cuban universities. Using an instrument in Spanish validated in Peruvian students, a confirmatory factor analysis was performed, structural equation modeling was used, and internal consistency was calculated with Cronbach's α coefficient. Results: 684 participants were included, of which 63.45 % were women and the mean age was 22.0 ± 1.71 years. From the initial scale of 12 items distributed in 2 factors, the factor analysis suggested eliminating item 5. The final model was made up of 11 items, 8 for factor 1 (Academic self-regulation) and 3 for factor 2 (Postponement of activities). A Cronbach's α coefficient of 0.786 (95 % CI = 0.75 – 0.81) was obtained, which indicates that the internal consistency of the instrument is good. Conclusions: The academic procrastination scale (EPA-11-Odonto) has evidence of validity and adequate reliability to evaluate the construct in Cuban dental students. © 2022, Editorial Ciencias Medicas.

In recent years a different construct has been identified—active procrastination—which implies the ability to deliberately delay tasks as to perform them more effectively. The research aims were: a) to analyze the profiles of active delay presented by students of the Educational Sciences, and b) to examine their differences according to gender and academic achievement. METHOD. The research involved 330 university students. The New Active Procrastination Scale was applied to obtain the profiles of the construct. A hierarchical Cluster analysis was performed with scale factors, a chi-square analysis crossing the Clusters and gender, and an univariate analysis of ANOVA variances with academic performance.

The results showed: a) the existence of four profiles among the students, named Active Procrastination, Passive Procrastination, Moderate Active Procrastination and Non-Procrastination; b) women had a non-procrastination profile to a greater extent than men; c) students with active procrastination and non procrastination profiles presented an academic performance significantly superior to the performance of students with passive procrastination. DISCUSSION. On the one hand, according to the analyzed construct, students who present active procrastination have the ability to delay their academic tasks in order to achieve higher performance as they are accustomed to working under pressure and managing work time. And on the other hand, those who present passive procrastination must be the object of intervention programs at the university in order to learn to organize themselves in their studies and overcome their failures of self-regulation. © Sociedad Española de Pedagogía.},

	abstract = {Deficit in the management of time continues to be an important difficulty students are faced with. The present work aimed to test the hypothesis that self-regulation is the major predictor of academic performance and that this effect can be mediated both by the student’s emotional regulation and his propensity for procrastination. Participants were 450 university students who were administered MPP and AIP. The procedures involved the administration of instruments and the collection of average exam grades as a measure of academic performance. The effect of a specific component of self-regulation on academic performance, namely action orientation, was significant, while procrastination showed a limiting effect on the performative quality of the student. The model confirmed the mediation role of emotional balance on the effect that action orientation exerts on procrastination, and the mediation of procrastination in the relationship between action orientation and Academic Performance. Results of the study suggest focusing on student support and on prevention of procrastinating behavior through programs that enhance first of all student’s proactive attitude, planning skills, self-monitoring and effective/efficient time management, and secondly, emotional awareness and regulation of emotional response in situations of stress and performance anxiety. © Copyright © 2021 Diotaiuti, Valente, Mancone and Bellizzi.},

Results revealed 46.8% of students as food insecure with statistically significant differences in race/ethnicity, GPA, and hours worked per week. Students who were observed with any level of food insecurity were more likely to also experience challenges with academics, careers, procrastination, and faculty as compared to their food secure counterparts. Analysis of differences in well-being indicators by food insecurity status revealed that students with any level of food insecurity were observed with statistically significantly higher mean scores for psychological distress, loneliness, and suicide behavior, with reduced scores for flourishing and resiliency as compared to their food secure counterparts.

	abstract = {This study aimed at investigating the effect of Psychological Capital (PsyCap) on students’ academic achievement and employees’ performance through procrastination at different levels of conscientiousness. The proposed theoretical model was examined using a moderated-mediation regression technique. The first group of participants comprised 1,670 university students from four major universities in the city of Makassar. Most of them were female (73.7%) with ages ranged from 17 to 24. The second group consisted of 400 employees (female, 57.5%) from five major organisations representing both private and public sectors in Makassar. The findings suggested that the students’ PsyCap had a negative direct impact on academic procrastination, but procrastination did not significantly impact students’ cumulative Grade-Point Average (GPA). The negative effect of PsyCap on students’ procrastination was stronger when students had low conscientiousness compared to high conscientiousness. On the other hand, employees’ PsyCap negatively predicted work procrastination and positively impacted the employees’ work performance. The results also indicated that procrastination negatively mediated the effect of PsyCap on employees’ performance. In brief, conscientiousness moderated the PsyCap-GPA relationship for students, while procrastination negatively mediated the PsyCap-employees’ performance relationship. © 2021 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Procrastination is defined as a behavioral tendency to postpone tasks that, because of their unmotivating or tedious characteristics, are not attractive to the performer, and whose delay can lead to negative consequences. This is the behavior of delaying responsibilities, being aware of their importance and the repercussions of the delay. These consequences can affect the personal, social, occupational and academic spheres of individuals. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to examine the relationship of academic procrastination and test anxiety on academic performance, as well as the relationship between the two variables. In this way, the aim is to achieve a better understanding of the links between the three variables, which will serve as a theoretical basis for preventing and intervening in the negative repercussions of procrastination. To this end, an investigation has been carried out with 201 college students, using the German Test Anxiety Inventory (GTAI-A), the Academic Procrastination Scale (EPA), and a record of the qualifications obtained by the participants collected through a self-report. This is a correlational design that does not include experimental manipulation of variables or randomization of the sample, so the aim is not to establish causal relationships but to determine the direction and strength of the associations between variables. The results reveal the presence of academic procrastination and test anxiety in university students. Specifically, the majority of participants (45.3 %) reflected a medium level of anxiety, 28.9 % reflected a high level and 25.9 % showed a low level. In the total sample, procrastination showed a mean score of 30.3 points out of 60. As for the relationships of both variables with academic performance, test anxiety shows a negative relationship with academic performance, so higher levels of anxiety are associated with worse grades. Procrastination does not show a significant and direct relationship with grades, but it is related to two anxiety factors (interference and lack of confidence), indirectly affecting academic performance. In addition, significant differences in academic performance have been found based on the different anxiety levels identified (χ2 (2,201) = 16.929; p =.001), with the high anxiety group obtaining a lower mean score (M = 5.74; SD = 1.27). This supports the hypothesis that test anxiety is negatively associated with academic performance. Moreover, it has been found that comparing the medium and low anxiety groups, the differences are not significant, but comparing each of them with the high anxiety group they are. Therefore, significant differences in the grades only appear when the level of anxiety is high. That is, a moderate level of anxiety is adaptive, and only becomes detrimental if it becomes high. In conclusion, to prevent and intervene in academic underachievement and associated psychosocial problems, university psychological services should consider the influence of test anxiety, procrastination and other cognitive, behavioral, motivational and emotional variables. According to this study, intervention in test anxiety is a central aspect, as it has a direct effect on academic performance. In the same way, procrastinating behaviors can be intervened, as they interfere indirectly in academic outcomes, being associated with cognitive manifestations of test anxiety. The relative weight of the different variables associated with academic achievement varies according to each student, so that an individualized approach to these types of problems would increase the levels of effectiveness and efficiency in the care provided by university psychological services. Finally, the need for more research to identify the factors associated with low academic performance and the relationships between them is highlighted, in order to facilitate the design of effective interventions for different student profiles. © 2021, Interdisciplinaria.

A cross-sectional study was carried out. The sample consisted of 124 nursing students. The Nomophobia Questionnaire, Mobile Phone Problematic Use Scale and Melbourne Decision Making Questionnaire were used for data collection. Regarding the results, the average total score of the Nomophobia Questionnaire was 69.50 ± 21.08, and the average total score of the Mobile Phone Problematic Use Scale was 83.60 ± 19.90 points. Positive correlations were found between the dimensions of nomophobia and the Mobile Phone Problematic Use Scale. Additionally, positive correlations were found between nomophobia and the dimensions of “buck-passing” (rs = 0.263; p = 0.017), procrastination (rs = 0.307; p = 0.011) and hypervigilance (rs = 0.284; p = 0.002) in regards to decision-making. As for the Mobile Phone Problematic Use Scale, a positive correlation was found between this scale and the procrastination dimension (rs = 0.128; p = 0.015). Problematic mobile phone use and/or nomophobia may have an influence on decision-making in nursing students. Levels of procrastination, hypervigilance and “buck-passing” in nursing students are affected by mobile phone use throughout their training. These factors may affect their academic performance, as well as their relationships with patients and other colleagues. © 2020},

A student who procrastinates may face internal consequences such as low academic performance, bad learning habits, and low learning motivation. When he/she is unable to address procrastination, this will hinder his/her academic performance. The study group of the research consists of 258 boys studying in high schools in the Riyadh region in the 2019-2020 academic year. They aged 16-18 years, (M= 17.23,SD= 4.45). Social Media Addiction Scale - Student Form, High-School Satisfaction Scale, and Tuckman's procrastination scale –short form were used for gathering and analyzing data. Quality of academic life correlates negatively with social networking addiction and academic procrastination.On the other hand, social networking addiction was found to be positively correlated with academic procrastination. Regression coefficients of the empirical model show that social networking addiction had a direct negative effect on the quality of academic life (b= -0.49, p<0.001) and a direct positive effect on academic procrastination (b=0.52, p<0.001). Results support previous research showing that social networking addiction negatively impacts academic achievement by creating academic procrastination, reducing sleep quality, and increasing academic stress. Evidence indicates a positive and significant correlation between inappropriate and problematic use of technology and quality of academic life.

However, research into instruments that measure self-direction in different student populations remains underdeveloped. The aim of this study was to examine the validity and reliability of the CIPA+ self-directed profile inquiry questionnaire (the Cuestionario de Indagación del Perfil Autodirigido), and to explore the relationship with academic procrastination. The participants were 194 Ecuadorian students of both genders (123 women) and various educational levels. Unlike the original four-factor CIPA+, factor analysis revealed a monofactorial structure with high internal consistency. It was found that self-direction has a low and negative relationship with academic procrastination, and that both men and women have the same level of self-direction and procrastination. In other words, it seems that an increase in student self-discipline and autonomy is associated with a reduction in postponing academic activities during online classes. It concludes by suggesting more CIPA+ studies in different populations, and that educators use these instruments accompanied by measurement of academic performance. © 2022 Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona.

The aim of the study was to analyze the predictive performance of the personal belief in a just world (PBJW) on students' life satisfaction and academic cheating and to take into account important mediators from the university context such as fellow student justice, lecturer justice, and procrastination. Derived from existing research, university students with a stronger PBJW should be more satisfied with their lives and cheat less than those with a weaker PBJW. The results support the hypothesized direct effects of PBJW on life satisfaction. Procrastination additionally mediated the effect of PBJW on life satisfaction. The level of PBJW predicted academic cheating only indirectly. The mediators procrastination and lecturer justice were crucial here. The results persisted when gender, learning, time to exam, socially desirable responding, general BJW, and self-efficacy were controlled. The findings were discussed in relation to the stressful situation caused by COVID-19.

	abstract = {Procrastination is generally recognized as a problematic behavior and the consequences of which spread to various aspects of an individual's life such as academic performance, social accomplishment, well-being, and health. Previous studies have indicated that neuroticism is positively correlated with procrastination; however, little is known about the neural substrates underlying the link between neuroticism and procrastination. To address this issue, we employed voxel‐based morphometry (VBM) and resting‐state functional connectivity (RSFC) methods to investigate the neural underpinning for their relationship in the present study (N = 153). Consistent with our hypothesis, the behavior results verified a positive correlation between neuroticism and procrastination (r = 0.47). The VBM analysis revealed that the gray matter (GM) volumes in the right middle temporal gyrus (RMTG) were positively correlated with neuroticism. Moreover, results from RSFC analysis suggested that the functional connectivity between RMTG and the right superior frontal gyrus (RSFG) was positively associated with neuroticism. More importantly, a mediation analysis demonstrated that neuroticism played a full mediating role in the impact of RMTG-RSFG functional connectivity on procrastination. Overall, the present study offered new insights into the relation between neuroticism and procrastination from a neural basis perspective, which also suggested the importance of emotional regulation with regard to the link between such an association. © 2021 IBRO},

Grades on the first homework assignment and test in each course were used as indices of students' early performance. Measures of procrastination and self-efficacy failed to adequately predict either early performance or attendance rates. Yet, attendance predicted a portion of the variance in assignment performance.

Among these have been calls for the cultivation of more effective self-regulation of media use. Against this backdrop, the present study investigates students’ self-regulation of off-task media in academic settings. Method: A series of focus groups was conducted involving 30 undergraduate students at a large, South African university. A combination of inductive and deductive analysis was conducted on the basis of prominent theories of self-regulation. Results: The presences of off-task media in academic settings create ongoing experiences of goal-conflict and many students become trapped in cycles of repeated self-regulation failure, ultimately culminating in procrastination. Conclusions: We refer to this phenomenon as the media procrastination cycle and argue that it contributes to negative affect, stress, and anxiety among students. © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {Academic procrastination is commonly found among undergraduates in different countries. Studies showed academic procrastination could be relevant to personality. Nonetheless, no study has examined the relationships between a Sense of Coherence and procrastination among undergraduate students. Studies revealed associations between academic procrastination and coping strategies, academic performance and sense of Coherence, and sense of Coherence and coping strategies. However, no analysis has been found examining the mechanism that connects the three variables to students' academic procrastination. Using the personality-coping-outcome theory as a framework, the present study hypothesized that coping strategy is the mediator for the effects of a Sense of Coherence (SOC) on academic procrastination. 99 undergraduates were recruited using a purposive sampling method through an online survey. The results showed that a Sense of Coherence has a direct effect and is partially mediated by a problem-focused coping strategy for academic procrastination. The findings support applying the personality-coping-outcome theory as a framework to understand the mechanism associated with a sense of Coherence and academic procrastination among undergraduates. More actions could be taken to cultivate the Sense of Coherence among undergraduates and to improve the use of problem-focused coping, a possible strategy to reduce academic procrastination commonly found among undergraduates. © 2022, Southeast Asian Association for Institutional Research.

The holistic empirical studies on multiple influencing factors of resilience among adolescent survivors after natural disasters are rarely reported, especially for those from culturally diverse groups. This study aimed to examine the resilience level and its influencing factors among Tibetan adolescent survivors ten years after the 2010 Yushu earthquake. Tibetan adolescent survivors were recruited from four Yushu middle schools from April to July 2020. They filled in the questionnaires about resilience, academic achievement attribution, academic procrastination, self-esteem, coping style, interpersonal competence, and earthquake preparedness. Independent t-test, one-way analysis of variance, Pearson correlation, and hierarchical regression analysis were used to analyze the data. A total of 559 questionnaires were included for analysis. Adolescents’ resilience was positively predicted by grade (senior two), gender (male), academic performance, effort attribution of academic achievement, self-esteem, problem-focused coping, interpersonal competence, and earthquake preparedness, while negatively predicted by academic procrastination. The investigated factors had an explanatory power of 34.6 %. The resilience of Tibetan adolescents is at the middle level, which is involved with Tibetan culture and psychosocial factors. To design a resilience intervention for this population, trainings on learning competence, self-esteem, coping, interpersonal competence, and earthquake preparedness may be beneficial. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

While procrastination has been found as a crucial indicator which negatively affects performance of students, no research has investigated this underlying factor in predicting achievement of students in online courses. In this study, we aim to predict students’ course achievement in Moodle through their procrastination behaviour using their homework submission data. We first build feature vectors of students’ procrastination tendencies by considering their active, inactive, and spare time for homework, along with homework grades. Accordingly, we then use clustering and classification methods to optimally sort and put students into various categories of course achievement. We use a Moodle course from the University of Tartu in Estonia which includes 242 students to assess the efficacy of our proposed approach. Our findings show that our approach successfully predicts course achievement for students through their procrastination behaviour with precision and accuracy of 87% and 84% with L-SVM outperforming other classification methods. Furthermore, we found that students who procrastinate more are less successful and are potentially going to do poorly in a course, leading to lower achievement in courses. Finally, our results show that it is viable to use a less complex approach that is easy to implement, interpret, and use by practitioners to predict students’ course achievement with a high accuracy, and possibly take remedial actions in the semester. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Generally conceptualized as a failure of performance, procrastination has been a central focus of psycho-educational research. Among the various facets of the construct, decisional procrastination has been scarcely analyzed in relation with self-regulated learning strategies. Assuming a cognitive standpoint we investigated the linkage between decisional procrastination and metacognitive beliefs about procrastination, taking into account self-regulated learning strategies as potential mediators. A sample of 296 undergraduate students filled out a questionnaire measuring metacognitive beliefs about procrastination, concentration on academic tasks and interests in academic success, and decisional procrastination. The hypothesized model was partially confirmed: Results from structural equation model indicated that: (1) positive metacognitive beliefs about procrastination had an adverse impact on both concentration and interests; (2) concentration mediated the relationship between positive metacognitions and decisional procrastination. Although the results were preliminary in nature, they provided a basis for examining procrastination as a barrier to academic success. Some professional indications for education were suggested. © 2019 Universidad de Almeria. All rights reserved.},

One of the primary factors influencing procrastination derives from the complexity of the assignment. Considering the research literature describes tight relationships between academic procrastination and academic achievement, one surprising finding concerns the fact that respondents saw no relationship between their procrastination and their final grade. A gap was found between students’ self-perception and their actual performance. Approximately 75% of the students perceive themselves as academic procrastinators, but in actuality nearly half of them completed the assignment on time. The starting date was found to be significant. Students who immediately began work upon receiving the assignment strongly tended to submit it on time. Students who did not begin early completed the project later than the scheduled date, if at all. © 2022, University of Wollongong. All rights reserved.},

In both samples, high impulsivity and high Behavioral Inhibition System (BIS) activation was associated with reports of general procrastination. In students, high Reward Reactivity (RR) was additionally associated with Unintentional Procrastination (UP), while low Goal-drive Persistence was associated with all forms of procrastination.

	abstract = {The link between depression, anxiety, and loneliness has been well established in the literature. Yet, the performance consequences of these negative mental health outcomes and the role of coping behaviors, as well as behavioral consequences such as procrastination as mediators have received far less research attention. Due to the COVID-19 social isolation restrictions, people are at risk of falling into a negative mental health spiral that can also affect their performance over time. The purpose of this longitudinal study among 881 first-year bachelor students is to explore the mechanisms by which loneliness, coping strategies in the context of COVID-19, mental health outcomes and procrastination sequentially mediate the relationship depression and anxiety on the one hand, and academic performance on the other hand. We measured mental health variables several times during the COVID-19 crisis and assessed how this translates into academic performance at the end of the academic year. By performing exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, three high-order factors for the coping strategies in the context of the COVID-19 crisis were identified, namely maladaptive coping, adaptive coping, and supportive coping. Structural equation modeling was used to test the sequential mediational model. The results showed that maladaptive coping strategies employed at T2 during the lockdown, but not adaptive or supportive coping partially mediate the trajectories of depression (T1) and anxiety (T1). Loneliness (T2) partially mediated the trajectory of depression and anxiety (T1), and procrastination fully mediated the impact of depression (T3) on academic performance (T4). These results help understand the mechanisms that influence mental health and academic performance outcomes in response to the COVID-19 crisis. Based on the study outcomes, educational researchers can test strategies to reduce the adverse effects of stressful situations in learning environments by targeting maladaptive coping behaviors and procrastination.

This study identifies a set of relationships among four variables using structural equation models. Each variable in the model is rooted in objective measurements through course website datasets and parametric empirical Bayes estimation obtained from 59 undergraduate engineering students. We found that the degree of procrastination, termed time-pressure reactivity in this model, mediates the relationship between early activity and academic performance.Wealso found significant gender differences among the four variables: Female students showed earlier activity and less procrastination, as well as greater academic performance, than male students. In practice, our findings suggest that the measurement of students' time logged on to access course website material can help researchers to estimate students' shortterm and long-term academic performance, as mediated through the individualized degree of procrastination. © 2019 TEMPUS Publications.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION. Procrastination involves a self-regulatory deficit, defined by the voluntary and irrational delay on the course of an action, that in turn generates negative consequences for an individual. It is reported in the literature that between 40 and 80% of students present procrastination conducts which negatively impact their performance, as well as their physical and mental health. There are various causes for procrastination that affect students differently in accordance to certain personal and social characteristics. For this study, three students’ profiles are categorised, according to the main reason to procrastinate: rebellion, fear of being assessed and laziness. The paper analyzed which traits characterize each reason: demographic traits (gender, age), academic traits (daily routine, semester, dedication, time planning, procrastination frequency, academic performance) and personal traits (good habits, psychological stability and self-regulation – goals, perseverance, decision making and learning from mistakes). METHOD. The sample was of 457 universtity students from different programs and semesters. The relation between the reasons to procrastinate and the demographic, academic and personal traits was explored through bivariate and punctual biserial correlations; and the relative weight of each variable on the three considered types of procrastination was assessed through multiple linear regression. RESULTS. It was found that the profile characterized by “rebellion” is associated with young men with low perseverance and decision making; “fear of being assessed” is associated to younger students, with less psychological stability and low capacity to make decisions; the “laziness” profile is associated to men with low general self-regulation. DISCUSSION. The implications for the design of preventive academic interventions for the management of procrastination, in accordance to the specific needs of each type of procrastination is discussed. © Sociedad Española de Pedagogía.},

Procrastination is one of the compelling characteristics that students observe as a failure to achieve the weaker outcomes. Past studies have mainly assessed the behaviors of procrastination by describing explanatory work. Throughout this research, we concentrate on predictive measures to identify and forecast procrastinator students by using ensemble machine learning models (i.e., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting, and Forest). Our results indicate that the Gradient Boosting autotuned is a predictive champion model of high precision compared to the other default and hyper-parameterized tuned models in the pipeline. The accuracy we enumerated for the VALIDATION partition dataset is 91.77 percent, based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistics. Additionally, our model allows teachers to monitor each procrastinator student who interacts with the web-based e-learning platform and take corrective action on the next day of the class. The earlier prediction of such procrastination behaviors would assist teachers in classifying students before completing the task, homework, or mastery of a skill, which is useful and a path to developing a sustainable atmosphere for education or education for sustainable development. © 2020 by the authors.},

Moreover, we investigated whether study skills mediate the relationship between procrastination and earned credits. University students (1303) at the end of their first year completed a survey including self-report measures, while performance data used (earned credits) are externally assessed. The results showed the important role of study skills in predicting credits and revealed that procrastination can lead to a problematic pace of studying due to the detrimental effect that this disposition has on study skills. Our findings suggest that interventions to help students to improve their planning and organizational skills could potentially counteract procrastination and facilitate better academic performance. © 2021 Societa Editrice il Mulino.

	abstract = {Background: University students are expected to take charge of their learning without being dependent on teachers. Self-regulated learning (SRL) is the process by which students direct their learning to achieve their set targets and goals in a timely and controlled manner. This study was undertaken to explore the practice of SRL by undergraduate students from different programs in a health science focused university during COVID-19 pandemic. Method: Thirty-three undergraduate students of five health professions education programs were recruited to take part in focus group discussions to explore their SRL practice with online learning. Their responses were subjected to thematic analysis. Result: Our students appeared to practice SRL, going through the phases of forethought and goal setting, performance and self-reflection. They set goals for academic as well as personal development in the university. Academic goals like achieving target GPA or marks were achieved by following different study techniques, personal management including time management, and by creating a conducive learning environment. Personal development such as interpersonal skills, social networking was achieved through socializing and participating in extracurricular activities. The students also engaged in self-reflection and analysis of their own performance followed by designing strategies to manage the challenges they faced. Conclusion: Undergraduates of health professions programs appear to show evidence of practicing SRL. Although impacted by COVID-19 induced lockdown and online learning, they seem to have strategized and achieved their goals through individualized SRL processes. Promoting and fostering an atmosphere of SRL in universities to cater to the needs of the students would help them be more successful in their careers.

	abstract = {The problem of mobile phone addiction and academic procrastination among medical students has been widely acknowledged. This study aimed to explore the influence of demographic factors on mobile phone addiction, academic procrastination, and academic achievement among medical students. Further, it investigated the association between mobile phone addiction, academic procrastination, and academic achievement. This cross-sectional study was conducted between May and June 2019. A total of 3 511 medical students participated in an online questionnaire survey (effective response rate = 81.7%). Demographic factors, the Scale of Academic Achievement, the short scale of the Mobile Phone Problem Use (MPPUS-10), and the Academic Procrastination Scale–Short (APS-S) were used. Hierarchical multiple regression analysis revealed that the average scores for academic procrastination, mobile phone addiction, and academic achievement were 2.66 ± 0.91, 5.13 ± 1.53, and 4.51 ± 0.71, respectively. Moreover, there were significant differences in gender, grade, leadership experience, and family monthly income across mobile phone addiction, academic procrastination, and academic achievement. Mobile phone addiction was negatively associated with learning dedication, learning performance, and relationship facilitation. Academic procrastination was negatively associated with learning dedication, learning performance, relationship facilitation, and objective achievement. Mobile phone addiction and academic procrastination was revealed as prevalent among Chinese medical students, and negatively influences their academic achievement. It is critical to establish a more efficient learning environment for Chinese medical students to minimize the negative impact of mobile phone addiction and academic procrastination.

Recent studies have reported the effects of exposure to nature sounds (e.g., the sounds of birds, rainfall, and waves) through a mobile application on reducing students’ mental fatigue and improving their cognitive performance. However, it remains unknown whether exposure to nature sounds through a mobile application may influence students’ learning performance. To address the gap, we conducted a study with 71 university students. During the four-week intervention, 36 students in the experimental group were exposed to nature sounds through a free mobile application for at least 30 consecutive minutes per day when working on academic-related tasks; 35 students in the control group did not have such exposure when working on similar tasks. The results show that students in the experimental group outperformed those in the control group in their engagement in deep learning, frequency of academic procrastination, and academic self-efficacy. The findings reveal the promising effects of exposure to nature sounds through a mobile application on improving students’ learning performance. The implications of the findings are discussed. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Background: Academic procrastination (AP) has been a common problematic behavior in college students. While physical activity (PA) has been reported to increase self-efficacy and reduce AP, less is known about the potential relationships among them. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the mediating effect of self-efficacy on the relationship between PA and AP. Methods: 687 Chinese college students (51% males, 49% females) aged 17–23 years (M = 19.59, SD = 0.89) participated in the study. PA, self-efficacy, and AP were assessed using the Physical Activity Rating Scale-3 (PARS-3), the Generalized Self-Efficacy Scale, and the Procrastination Assessment Scale-Students (PASS), respectively. Pearson correlation analysis, linear regression analysis, and mediation analysis were used to analyze the data. Results: (1) PA has a significant and negative impact on college students’ AP, (2) PA has a significant and positive impact on college students’ self-efficacy; (3) self-efficacy has a significant and negative impact on AP in college students; and (4) self-efficacy significantly mediates the relationship between PA and AP. Conclusions: PA is an effective intervention for directly and indirectly decreasing college students’ AP. Therefore, more intervention efforts should focus on the promotion of PA in higher education to improve students’ self-efficacy and thus, to reduce AP among college students. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {A high percentage of university students postpone their academic activities, which leads to academic and personal difficulties. The aim of this work is to identify and describe academic procrastination and its link to the use of metacognitive learning strategies, socio-affective strategies, and academic performance in pre-service teachers. The sample was made up of 794 bachelor’s and master’s degree students in teacher education who completed the Academic Procrastination Scale, the Procrastination Assessment Scale-Student (PASS), and the Metacognitive Strategies and Socio-affective Strategies scales of the ACRA scales. Descriptive, correlational, sample contrast, and hierarchical linear regression analysis shows there is a high percentage of students who habitually procrastinate, and who believe their behavior to be detrimental to them. Academic procrastination is negatively related to academic performance and the use of metacognitive and socio-affective strategies. Women evidence a lower level of academic procrastination than their male counterparts, although they believe it to be more detrimental to their academic activities. There are also differences in that women attribute the problem more to a lack of empathy and lack of self-confidence, whereas in men the problem is linked to the search for excitement. The variables which most predict procrastination are the low use of metacognitive strategies and the lack of energy and self-control. No differences were found between the years of the degree, age or regarding whether students are working or not, or the dedication this entails. We discuss the implications of the results in specific actions aimed at reducing procrastination behavior in university students. © 2022, Univ Nacional de Educacion a Distancia (UNED).

Such challenges may arise as students face normative but novice stressors while working towards professional goals. Students’ ability to engage in successful self-regulation may be especially important in response to these challenges. The goals of the present study were to assess a) the mediating role of self-regulatory behaviors on the relationship between trait emotion regulation and negative affect (NA) on the day of a first major college exam; and b) the mediating role of exam-day NA on the relationship between self-regulatory behaviors and exam performance. Results show that trait-level challenges in emotion regulation are associated with increased procrastination behaviors in the days before the exam, which in turn is associated with higher NA on exam day. Implications are discussed for well-being and success of students, particularly for students who struggle with self-regulation. © The Author/s 2021.},

Studies have shown that students who demonstrate higher procrastination tendencies achieve less than the students with lower procrastination tendencies. It is important for a teacher to be aware of the students' behaviors especially their procrastination trends. EDM techniques can be used to analyze data collected through computer-supported learning environments and to predict students' behaviors. In this paper, we present an algorithm called students' academic performance enhancement through homework late/non-submission detection (SAPE) for predicting students' academic performance. This algorithm is designed to predict students with learning difficulties through their homework submission behaviors. First, students are labeled as procrastinators or non-procrastinators using k-means clustering algorithm. Then, different classification methods are used to classify students using homework submission feature vectors. We use ten classification methods, i.e., ZeroR, OneR, ID3, J48, random forest, decision stump, JRip, PART, NBTree, and Prism. A detailed analysis is presented regarding performance of different classification methods for different number of classes. The analysis reveals that in general the prediction accuracy of all methods decreases with increase in the number of classes. However, different methods perform best or worst for different number of classes.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Numerous students suffer from academic procrastination; it is a common problem and phenomenon in academic settings. Many previous researchers have analyzed its relationships with other factors, such as self-regulation and academic success. This paper aims to provide a full outline of academic procrastination and explore the current hot spots and trends. Bibliometrix and VOSviewer were used to conduct quantitative analysis. The data was collected from the Web of Science core collection database, which contains 1,240 articles from the years 1938 to 2021. The analysis shows that the publication of articles on academic procrastination has been rapidly increasing since 1993. In terms of the most influential countries and institutions, the United states took a prominent lead among all countries, and the most productive institutions in this area were the University of Washington and University of California, Los Angeles. By analyzing the authors, we see that most authors like working with a few collaborators, leading to main groups of authors, such as Murat Balkis and June J. Pilcher. The most frequently cited author was Esther D. Rothblum. Based on the co-citation journals network, Personality and Individual Differences was the prolific and influential journal referring to the number of citations and articles it received. The VOSviewer tool identified the hot spots of academic procrastination, which were mainly distributed as follows: (a) procrastination, (b) academic procrastination, (c) self-regulation, (d) academic performance, and (e) motivation. Therefore, this paper is helpful for scholars and practitioners to know the trend of academic procrastination research comprehensively. Copyright © 2021 Tao, Hanif, Ahmed and Ebrahim.},

	abstract = {Procrastination on social networking sites (SNS) can impact academic performance and user's well-being. SNSs embed features that encourage users to be always connected and updated, e.g., the notification features. Such persuasive features can exploit peer pressure as well and lead users to believe they are expected to interact immediately, especially for those who may have less impulse control and seek for relatedness and popularity. We argue that SNS can be built to host countermeasures for such behavior and help people regulate their usage and preoccupation about it better. In this paper, we presented a mixed-method study including a qualitative (i.e., focus groups, diary, interviews, and co-design) and a quantitative phase (i.e., a survey) with 334 participants. Through the qualitative phase, we identified: (1) features of an SNS seen by participants as facilitators for procrastination, e.g., notification, immersive design, and surveillance of presence, and (2) countermeasures, such as reminders, chat timer, and goal setting, can be facilitated via SNS design to combat procrastination, and (3) a pairing between the features and the countermeasures. We then (4) confirmed these results and the pairing through the survey phase. Our study showed that countermeasures could be implemented to be universal across all SNS on one or even more device. © 2010 2020},

	abstract = {Introduction: Procrastination is leaving things for the last minute, this can have repercussions in the academic domain. Objective: To determine the academic factors associated with general procrastination. Methods: An analytical cross-sectional study was carried out in students of a particular university in the Peruvian highlands, as preliminary results from all faculties of a university in the city of Huancayo-Peru. The procrastinators were the students who were in the upper third of the total score of a validated test, then associated with educational factors. Association statistics were obtained. Results: 5 812 students were surveyed. 48 % (2 776) were men, with a median age of 20 years. In the multivariate analysis, the highest frequency of procrastination occurred in male students (p: 0.005), among those who were younger (p: 0.003), less daily hours of study (p< 0.001) and lower weighted averages in the previous cycle (p< 0.001). Likewise, the faculties of health sciences (p: 0.005) and law (p: 0.006) had lower frequencies of procrastination; adjusted by four variables. Conclusions: Those with more demanding studies and the students who carry out the most academic activities are those who procrastinate the least, this can help to generate strategies and support students who have these inadequate study habits. © 2018, Editorial Ciencias Medicas.

One of these factors is academic procrastination, which affects over 70% of college students, including students with LD. The present study examined the relationship between academic procrastination and academic performance, and the moderating role of LD in this relationship. Findings showed a negative effect of academic procrastination on GPA, and more strongly for students with LD, indicating that a high-level of procrastination might be more harmful for these students’ academic performance. These initial findings contribute to the body of knowledge concerning students with LD in higher education. They emphasize the need to support students with LD in a manner that will address the specific difficulties that may lead to higher rates of procrastination and subsequently lower academic achievement. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Academic procrastination is a behaviour that affects a high percentage of university students, which has been extensively addressed in the scientific literature. Although the frequency of procrastination and its relation to other variables has been studied extensively, there are fewer studies focused on the motives that lead to procrastination. In the present study, we analyse the reasons for procrastinating in a sample of 433 students from the University of Cádiz, using the Procrastination Assessment Scale-Students (PASS). The answers obtained have allowed to carry out a classification of the students according to their motivations. The results indicate that three types of students can be differentiated, which would procrastinate respectively for an inadequate response to the demands of the task, due to fear and insecurity, or for a search for excitement and dependence on others. Each of these types has been characterized according to personal and academic characteristics. Age, academic year, time planning, intensity of procrastination, self-concept as a student and self-efficacy are relevant factors in the differentiation between types of students with different motives to procrastinate. On the other hand, the variables gender, simultaneous studies with paid work and academic performance do not have significant effects. We make a discussion of the results obtained and we reflect on the intervention aimed at reducing academic procrastination in university students. © 2020 Asociacion Interuniversitaria de Investigacion en Pedagogia.

Meanwhile, international postgraduate students’ disengagement tendency and learned helplessness in dealing with supervisor’s moral disengagement will significantly affect their academic choices and outcomes. Methods: Based on self-determination theory, this research distributed 350 questionnaires through two-stage time-lagged method and 266 valid questionnaires were recovered. Hierarchical regression analysis examined the direct effect of supervisor’ moral disengagement on international postgraduate students’ academic procrastination, as well as the moderating effect of international postgraduate students’ moral disengagement and learned helplessness. Results: The results indicated that 1) supervisor’s moral disengagement significantly predicts international postgraduate students’ academic procrastination, 2) international postgraduate students’ moral disengagement and learned helplessness positively moderate the above relation, and 3) international postgraduate students’ learned helplessness positively moderates the moderating effect of international postgraduate students’ moral disengagement. Conclusion: This study revealed the antecedents and conditions of international postgraduate students’ academic procrastination, which enriched the theoretical connotation and practical application of self-determination theory in the field of international postgraduate students’ education. © 2022 Wu and He.},

They were assigned into two academic writing classes. Each group consisted of 25 male and female students. To collect data, the researchers applied the Procrastination Assessment Scale for Students. The items were scored on a five-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (never procrastinate) to 5 (always procrastinate). Descriptive and inferential statistics were applied to analyze the data. Results revealed that procrastination was decreased in both groups receiving audio-visual and traditional feedback, but providing audio-visual feedback was more effective in decreasing procrastination levels in writing of these students.

We examined direct and indirect associations between course engagement-related constructs, math attitudes, and learning outcomes. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to validate scores from measures of these constructs with a sample of high school students enrolled in Advanced Placement (AP) statistics (N = 720, mean age = 16.8 years, SD = 0.82). Structural equation models were fitted to the data to examine relations between these constructs on a subsample (N = 220). A greater proportion of variation was explained in a high-stakes learning outcome (R2 = 0.54) than a low-stakes learning outcome (R2 = 0.24). We found some evidence of indirect effects of academic procrastination and course engagement on the learning outcome by way of math attitudes. The findings shed light on opportunities for intervention on academic maladaptive behaviors, such as procrastination, which could lessen negative effects on math attitudes and learning. These findings highlight the importance of testing stakes when examining associations between engagement, math attitudes, and learning, particularly in the context of high school statistics, a growing and yet understudied STEM learning context. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

The present research aims to explore the interrelationships among Bedtime Procrastination, other domains of Procrastination, and routine-related variables. Methods: The mediating effects of Wake-up Time and Dinner Time on the relationship between Bedtime Procrastination and General Procrastination, Academic Procrastination, and Perceived Importance of Sleep were tested. Self-reported questionnaires were used, and the sample comprised of 446 university students. Results: A partial mediation model was found. General Procrastination, Academic Procrastination, and Perceived Importance of Sleep showed direct effects on Bedtime Procrastination. Moreover, Academic and General Procrastination were positively associated with Bedtime Procrastination, whereas Perceived Importance of Sleep was negatively associated with Bedtime Procrastination. Indirect effects of the Perceived Importance of Sleep and General Procrastination, as mediated by Wake-up Time and Dinner Time, on Bedtime Procrastination were also found. Conclusions: Personal routines (Wake-up Time and Dinner Time) along with individual characteristics (General and Academic Procrastination) and beliefs (perceived importance of sleep) may affect Bedtime Procrastination. Present results highlight the complexity of Bedtime Procrastination. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

Supporting this notion, our studies corroborate that trait self-control is negatively associated (1) with students' distraction (via smartphones) during their learning endeavors (Study 1, N = 446) and (2) with several aspects of problematic smartphone-use (Study 2, N = 421). Study 3 (N = 106) investigated whether distinct aspects of smartphone-use also account for the link between students' trait self-control and academic performance. Specifically, we examined (1) smartphone procrastination (i.e., irrational task delays via smartphone), (2) beneficial smartphone habits (placing in a bag [placement habit] or turning the sound off [setting habit]), and (3) the objective amount of smartphone-use (minutes spent on the smartphone [screentime] and times picked up [pickups]). In line with our predictions, students higher in trait self-control showed better academic performance (β = 0.22). Smartphone procrastination (β = −0.23) and placement habits (β = 0.21) were significantly associated with academic performance and both also mediated the self-control-performance-link. Our findings suggest that it is not the objective amount of smartphone-use but the effective handling of smartphones that helps students with higher trait self-control to fare better academically.

Participants: One hundred fourteen undergraduates were recruited for study participation. Methods: Participants completed measures of academic performance, procrastination, ADHD symptoms, EFs (as measured by five EF facets: time management, organization/problem-solving, restraint, motivation, and emotion regulation), and common comorbid concerns for college students between May 2017 and May 2018. A mediational framework was utilized to examine the associations among procrastination, EFs, and four ADHD symptoms domains. Results: Results indicated that both procrastination and GPA correlated with EFs and three ADHD symptom domains. While EFs mediated the association between procrastination and ADHD symptoms, follow-up analyses suggested that self-management of time and organization/problem-solving are the specific pathways through which procrastination is indirectly associated with ADHD symptoms.

	abstract = {Procrastination is prevalent among students and is associated with negative outcomes, including poor academic performance and psychological distress. Research also suggests that anxiety and depression can exacerbate procrastination; however, the mechanisms associated with the development of procrastination are less understood. The current study aimed to clarify the role of negative repetitive thought (i.e., rumination and worry) in the links between anxiety and procrastination, and depression and procrastination. Ninety-one undergraduate students completed self-report measures of anxiety, depression, worry, brooding rumination, and procrastination, and two multiple mediator models were tested. Procrastination was positively correlated with the study variables, including medium effects for anxiety and depression, a large effect for rumination, and a small effect for worry. Rumination independently mediated the relationships between anxiety and procrastination, and depression and procrastination. Worry did not independently mediate these relationships. The current findings suggest rumination plays a larger role in the links between anxiety, depression, and procrastination than worry. Thus, students with higher levels of anxiety and depression engage in more negative repetitive thought, which may contribute to procrastinatory behavior as a result of a preoccupation with depressing or painful thoughts about the past. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

	abstract = {Introduction. A common impediment to any student's academic achievement and well being is the phenomenon of procrastination. Procrastination has typically been defined as a trait or behavioural disposition to postpone or delay performing a task or making decision. It is vol-untary yet irrational delay of an intended course of action and frequently results in unsatisfactory, performance and emotional upset. Whereas, active procrastination is one's intentional decision to procrastinate in order to cope and focus attention on other tasks at hand and to experience performance pressure. Method. This study attempted to explore pre-University college (PUC) students' active pro-crastination in relation to their self-regulated learning. 120 PUC students were selected from four different schools of Gulbarga town in Karnataka state of India through multistage ran-dom sampling. With the demographic details of students, they were administered Active pro-crastination scale and Self-regulated learning measure. Results. Students of Educated parents and boys have higher active procrastination. Urban and rural students do not differ in their active procrastination. Goal setting & planning, seeking information, keeping records and rehearsing & memorizing strategies are significantly related to active procrastination Discussion and Conclusion. Urban students have higher organizing & transforming, rehearsing & memorizing and seeking social assistance SRL strategies. Students who engage in more than one hobby have better goal setting & planning, information seeking & total SRL. Active procrastination has significant relation with goal setting & planning, seeking information, keeping records, rehearsing & memorizing SRL strategies. © University of Almería and Ilustre Colegio Oficial de la Psicología de Andalucía Oriental (Spain).},

	abstract = {Writer’s block, a common form of procrastination, can have a serious negative impact on an individual’s academic performance. In this case study, a student with writer’s block was interviewed and asked to perform body movements that represented the process of writing a master’s thesis. A micro-phenomenological method was used to investigate the student’s experience of writer’s block and the role of an inner voice. The analysis unveiled the process by which the inner voice impeded the student, i.e. how the student perceived a set of mental images, movements, and sensations in relation to the ‘inner voice’. The findings suggest that non-verbal modes of learning — through movement — may be applied productively to overcome writer’s block and other forms of procrastination in broader areas such as research writing. Moreover, the micro-phenomenological method, together with the interpretation of video recordings, can reveal valuable information regarding this learning process in higher education. © 2018, Imprint Academic.

	abstract = {This research aimed to analyze the linear bivariate correlation and structural relations between self-regulation -as a central construct-, with flow, health, procrastination and academic performance, in an academic context. A total of 363 college students took part, 101 men (27.8%) and 262 women (72.2%). Participants had an average age of 22 years and were between the first and fifth year of studies. They were from five different programs and two universities in Bogotá city (Colombia). A validated ad hoc questionnaire of physical and psychological health was applied along with a battery of tests to measure self-regulation, procrastination, and flourishing. To establish an association relationship, Pearson bivariate correlations were performed using SPSS software (v. 22.0), and structural relationship predictive analysis was performed using an SEM on AMOS software (v. 22.0). Regarding this linear association, it was established that (1) self-regulation has a significant positive association on flourishing and overall health, and a negative effect on procrastination. Regarding the structural relation, it confirmed that (2) self-regulation is a direct and positive predictor of flourishing and health; (3) self-regulation predicts procrastination directly and negatively, and academic performance indirectly and positively; and (4) age and gender have a prediction effect on the analyzed variables. Implications, limitations and future research scope are discussed. © 2018 Garzón-Umerenkova, de la Fuente, Amate, Paoloni, Fadda and Pérez.},

We focus our attention on student outliers. Students whose first-year college average is far below expectations (divers) have a high propensity for procrastination – they self-report cramming for exams and wait longer before starting assignments. They are also considerably less conscientious than their peers. Divers are more likely to express superficial goals, hoping to ‘get rich’ quickly. In contrast, students who exceed expectations (thrivers) express more philanthropic goals, are purpose-driven, and are willing to study more hours per week to obtain the higher GPA they expect. A simple seven-variable average of these key non-academic variables does well in predicting college achievement relative to adding more variables or letting a machine-algorithm choose, and improves our ability to predict at-risk students when used jointly with past grades. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

The growing number of students with learning disabilities (LD) in higher education communities leads to the need to study and address academic procrastination in this unique population of students and to develop ways to prevent and intervene. The present study examined the difference in academic procrastination between LD, non-LD, and supported LD college students in Israel. Findings indicated a significant difference between the three groups, both in academic procrastination and in the desire to change this behavior. Interestingly, supported LD students were similar to non-LD students in all parameters of academic procrastination; however, they expressed less desire to change this behavior than unsupported LD students. These findings highlight the effect of general academic support on academic procrastination in LD students. Future studies will need to further explore the specific elements of support that most contribute to the reduction of academic procrastination in LD students. Specific support programs for academic procrastination in LD students who take into account the findings of these future studies can then be developed and studied. © 2018 Taylor & Francis.},

This study explored the difficulties experienced by university students with ADHD symptoms. Methods: Between December 2015 and February 2016, face-to-face interviews were conducted with 12 university students with self-reported ADHD symptoms. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis. Results: Difficulties in university life were classified into four main themes (lack of daily routine, unsatisfactory academic performance and achievement, reduced interpersonal skills, and continuing worries) and analyzed. University students with ADHD symptoms had difficulties coping with repeated cycles of negative thoughts and worries, irregular lifestyles due to poor time management, dissatisfaction with academic performance and interpersonal relationships, self-dissatisfaction, and decreased self-esteem. Conclusion: To improve their university experience, students with ADHD should receive education about ways to stop worrying, to express emotions healthily, and to manage time efficiently. © 2018 The Author(s).},

In the present study, we developed and evaluated a group training that aimed to reduce academic procrastination. We based the training on a cyclical process model of self-regulated learning, thus, focusing on improving deficient processes of self-regulated learning among academic procrastinators (e.g., time management, dealing with distractions). The training comprised five sessions and took place once a week for 90 min in groups of no more than 10 students. Overall, 106 students completed the training. We evaluated the training using a comprehensive control group design with repeated measures (three points of measurement); the control group was trained after the intervention group’s training. The results showed that our training was successful. The trained intervention group significantly reduced academic procrastination and improved specific processes of self-regulated learning (e.g., time management, concentration), whereas the untrained control group showed no change regarding these variables. After the control group had also been trained, the control group also showed the expected favorable changes. The students rated the training overall as good and found it recommendable for procrastinating friends. Hence, fostering self-regulatory processes in our intervention was a successful attempt to support students in reducing academic procrastination. The evaluation of the training encourages us to adapt the training for different groups of procrastinators. © 2018 Taylor & Francis.},

The relationships between procrastination, disorganisation, the forethought phase of self-regulated learning (SRL), academic performance and self-regulation failure are addressed. Self-report scales were used to assess procrastination, disorganisation, and forethought. Three hypotheses about the relationships between these dimensions were tested. The first is that disorganisation and procrastination are two distinct constructs; it is argued that they represent two routes via which self-regulation failure can be manifested. The second is that disorganisation and procrastination have a negative impact on academic performance; the results obtained showed that only disorganisation had a negative impact on academic performance. The third is that the implementation of high-quality processes during the forethought phase is a safeguard against disorganisation and procrastination. © 2018, Western Australian Institute for Educational Research Inc.
